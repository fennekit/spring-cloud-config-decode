# Introduction

Spring Cloud Config is a configuration server capable of serving encrypted secrets
that are decrypted by a client library. 

[Steeltoe.Config](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Documentation/blob/v4/api/v4/configuration/encryption-resolver.md) (v4.0) is such a client library capable of decrypting these.

This tool fills the gap where the secrets can be create in the .NET ecosystem.
